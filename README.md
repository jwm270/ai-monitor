## ðŸ›  Troubleshooting

### Port 4000 Already in Use (`EADDRINUSE`)

```
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::4000
```
Fix:
```powershell
taskkill /F /IM node.exe
npm run dev
```

### OneDrive File Lock Issues (`EPERM: operation not permitted`)
Cause: OneDrive sometimes locks files inside `C:\Users\<you>\OneDrive\...`.

Fix: Move your project to a non-OneDrive folder (e.g., `C:\dev\ai-monitor`).

---

### Execution Policy Blocks `npm` / `npx`
Error:
```
npm.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system
```
Fix (temporary for current session):
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```
Or permanent (safer scope):
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Force
```

### Prisma Errors: Missing Relations
Error:
```
The relation field ... is missing an opposite relation field
```
Fix: Update `prisma/schema.prisma` so every relation has an opposite side. Run:
```powershell
npx prisma format
npx prisma generate
```

---

### Seed Data Not Appearing
If login fails with demo users:
```powershell
node prisma/seed.js
```
This reseeds demo accounts like:
- `admin@demo.local / demo1234`
- `manager@demo.local / demo1234`
- `client@demo.local / demo1234`
- `victim@demo.local / demo1234`
